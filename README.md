Flutter is Google's SDK for crafting beautiful, fast user experiences for
mobile, web and desktop from a single codebase. Flutter works with existing
code, is used by developers and organizations around the world, and is free
and open source.

## About Flutter

We think Flutter will help you create beautiful, fast apps, with a productive,
extensible and open development model.

### Beautiful user experiences

We want to enable designers to deliver their full creative vision without being
forced to water it down due to limitations of the underlying framework.
Flutter's [layered architecture] gives you control over every pixel on the
screen, and its powerful compositing capabilities let you overlay and animate
graphics, video, text and controls without limitation. Flutter includes a full
[set of widgets][widget catalog] that deliver pixel-perfect experiences on both
iOS and Android.

### Fast results

Flutter is fast. It's powered by the same hardware-accelerated [Skia] 2D
graphics library that underpins Chrome and Android. We architected Flutter to
support glitch-free, jank-free graphics at the native speed of your device.
Flutter code is powered by the world-class [Dart platform], which enables
compilation to 32-bit and 64-bit ARM machine code for iOS and Android, as well
as JavaScript for the web and Intel x64 for desktop devices.

### Productive development

Flutter offers stateful hot reload, allowing you to make changes to your code
and see the results instantly without restarting your app or losing its state.

### Extensible and open model

Flutter works with any development tool (or none at all), but includes editor
plug-ins for both [Visual Studio Code] and [IntelliJ / Android Studio]. Flutter
provides [thousands of packages][Flutter packages] to speed your development,
regardless of your target platform. And accessing other native code is easy,
with support for both [FFI] and [platform-specific APIs][platform channels]. 

Flutter is a fully open source project, and we welcome contributions.
Information on how to get started can be found at our
[contributor guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).
